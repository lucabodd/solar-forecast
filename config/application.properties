# Solar Forecast Warning System - Configuration

# ========================================
# LOCATION SETTINGS
# ========================================
# Your geographic coordinates for weather forecast
# Valencia, Spain (L'Enova)
latitude=39.47
longitude=-0.38

# ========================================
# ALERT THRESHOLD CRITERIA
# Duration-based alert: triggers when production drops below threshold for 6+ consecutive hours
# ========================================

# Production Alert Threshold (kW)
# Alert if estimated output drops below this value
# For 8.9kW system: use 2.0 kW
production_alert_threshold_kw=2.0

# Duration Threshold (hours)
# Alert only if below production threshold for this many consecutive hours
# Prevents false positives from brief cloud cover
# Recommended: 6 hours
duration_threshold_hours=6

# ========================================
# ANALYSIS WINDOW (DEPRECATED - now uses automatic daylight detection)
# The system now automatically detects daylight hours using GHI (solar irradiance)
# This adapts to seasonal changes and is more accurate than fixed times
# These settings are kept for backward compatibility but are no longer used
# ========================================
# analysis_window_start=8  # DEPRECATED - system now uses GHI-based daylight detection
# analysis_window_end=20   # DEPRECATED - system now uses GHI-based daylight detection

# ========================================
# SOLAR PANEL CONFIGURATION
# ========================================
# Rated capacity in kilowatts (at Standard Test Conditions)
# Your system: 16 panels × 560W = 8.96 kW ≈ 8.9 kW
# This is the manufacturer's rated output at STC (1000 W/m², 25°C)
# The rated capacity ALREADY includes panel efficiency (~20% silicon conversion)
rated_capacity_kw=8.9

# Panel efficiency (DEPRECATED - not used in calculations)
# The rated capacity already accounts for panel efficiency
# This setting is kept for backward compatibility but is not used
# Typical silicon panels: 0.18-0.22 (18-22% conversion efficiency)
# panel_efficiency=0.20  # DEPRECATED - do not use

# Inverter efficiency (0.0-1.0)
# Accounts for DC to AC conversion losses
# Typical: 0.95-0.98 (95-98% efficient)
inverter_efficiency=0.97

# Temperature coefficient (% per °C above 25°C)
# Typical: -0.4 to -0.5
# Formula: efficiency_adjustment = 1 - (temp_coefficient/100 * (temp - 25))
temp_coefficient=-0.4

# ========================================
# Hour to start checking during daytime (0-23, 24-hour format)

# Hour to stop checking during daytime (0-23, 24-hour format)
# Use 24 for no upper limit, or specific hour like 18 for 6pm
